# Bug Tracker

The Bug Tracker app is a tool used to report and track issues (bugs) in software development projects.

The app utilises a multi-company and role-based security system, which restricts access to certain pages and actions. Demo accounts are provided for visitors to view the app, however persistent CRUD operations cannot update the database in the demo accounts.

The app was built with ASP.NET MVC, C# and SQL. The front end was developed with HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap, using a bootstrap template as a foundation. The backend utilises MVC and C#, with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Heroku. Heroku is a platform as service (PaaS) that enables developers to run and operate applications in the cloud.
